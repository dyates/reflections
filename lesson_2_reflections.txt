What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you run 'git init' it creates the .git directory and
creates/intializes the repository.  If you don't do this then you cannot
do any commits which means you will not be taking advantage of the
 benefits of version control.

 How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
 repository? What value do you think it offers?
 The staging area is where you add files (from the working directory) that will be commited when you use the 'git commit' command.
