What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you run 'git init' it creates the .git directory and
creates/intializes the repository.  If you don't do this then you cannot
do any commits which means you will not be taking advantage of the
 benefits of version control.

 How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
 repository? What value do you think it offers?
 The staging area is where you add files (from the working directory) that will be commited when you use the 'git commit' command.  The 
 value that this offers is that it allows you to specify what you 
 want and what you do not want in your commits.

 How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per
 logical change?
 Commits can only be made from the staging area.  So, even though you can be working on multiple files, you can add one file or more that represents a logical change to the staging area and commit the files to the repository.  The staging area allows you to control what you commit to your repository.
