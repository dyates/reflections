When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keep all your work local?
When files/projects start to get large then it may not be a good idea to keep everything local. Having a remote repository allows you to access
your work anywhere.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Beacause your local repository may have changes that your remote repository may not have. Or vice versa. You would not want your remote 
and local repositories to auto-lync because you don't want to lose work that you have done. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Branches act on repositories and create different commit paths in
the repository.  Clones are copies of existing repositories.  A
fork is a clone of someone else's remote repository that goes directly to your remote repository (on GitHub).
