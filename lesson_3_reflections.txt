When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keep all your work local?
When files/projects start to get large then it may not be a good idea to keep everything local. 
Having a remote repository allows you to access your work anywhere.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
up-to-date with your remote repository?
Beacause your local repository may have changes that your remote repository may not have.  Or vice versa. 
You would not want your remote and local repositories to auto-lync because you don't want to lose
work that you have done.
